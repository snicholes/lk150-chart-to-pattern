# simple chart-to-pattern generator for flatbed knitting machines

this repo provides a basic page where you can "draw" two-color charts (for example, fair isle) and turn them into patterns for a non-punchcard flatbed knitting machine such as a silver reed lk150 (that's what i have, anyway).

## how to use it

this describes how to use it on a computer (PC/mac desktop or laptop). sorry, i don't really know how to do it on a phone or tablet, so i suggest doing it on the computer then taking screenshots of the patterns to send to yourself (via email for example), then you can open it on your phone or tablet if that's where you like to have it. you can also print out the screenshots or even print from the browser if you like to have a physical copy.

1. download the files in this repository. if you're not familiar with git, you can just click the green "Code" dropdown above and you'll see an option to "Download ZIP".
2. find the files on your computer wherever you downloaded them and open the file "patternGen.html". your computer should allow you to open this file directly which will open it in your default browser (firefox, chrome, opera, edge, whatever you use).
3. on the page, enter the width and height (i.e. stitches and rows respectively) of your desired pattern, then click "update" to update the size of the drawing grid.
4. draw in the grid by clicking on squares to change which color to use. there is a key to remember which color is which in the final pattern.
5. set the starting direction for the pattern (e.g. if the first row in the colorwork is left-to-right or right-to-left). default is right-to-left such that color changes happen on the left side.
6. when you're happy with what you've drawn, click "generate" under the chart to generate the pattern.
7. the pattern will be generated underneath with a key to specify which hooks should be in which position, and the color and direction for each row will be along the right side of the chart.

## how to knit with the pattern on silver reed lk150

i would like to add more detailed instructions later; don't have enough time at the moment to type it out.

main tips:

- the pattern reads from bottom to top, so the bottom row is the first row you will work.
- your side lever should be in "do not knit position B" mode, which on my silver reed lk150 is a circle (instead of a triangle). this slips the stitches that are on hooks in position B.
- your russel lever should be in "knit position D & return to position B" mode, which on my silver reed lk150 is II (instead of I).
